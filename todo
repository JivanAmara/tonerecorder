 - Host on website.  There's a problem creating the uploaded file on
   the server.  Not sure exactly what it is.
 - Include CSRF protection for listenup.
 - Form validation (filename?)
 - Add fields in recorder for sound/tone/user
 - Design:
 	 - prompting user for unrecorded syllables
 	 - remembering user
 	 - organizing uploaded files (model for file upload?)

Notes:
 - form tag must include 'enctype="multipart/form-data"' or file won't upload
 - listenup file input field is called 'userfile'
 - Just like a form action value, the upload URL must have a trailing slash
 	- If not, you will get a not-so-helpful http 500 error.
 - Just do an HttpResponse with 'SUCCESS' at the start of the line to have
 	the recorder add it to the interface as a notice.
