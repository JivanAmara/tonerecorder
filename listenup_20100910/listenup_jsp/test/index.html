   <title>Testing ListenUp with JSP</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>ListenUp, JSP Guide</h1>
(C) 2003 Softsynth.com

<p>Here is a series of incremental tests to see if ListenUp was installed
correctly.
<p><strong>THESE TESTS MUST BE BROWSED FROM YOUR WEB SERVER, NOT FROM YOUR LOCAL HARD DRIVE!</strong>
<h3>
1) <a href="hello.jsp">Hello JSP</a></h3>
Make sure
Tomcat is serving jsp pages properly from the new <tt>listenup_jsp</tt>
webapp
<h3>
2) <a href="test_fileupload_install.jsp">Test Access to Commons FileUpload JAR</a></h3>
<p>If you are using Commons FileUpload jar to handle multipart form
    requests, then verify that Tomcat's class loader can access it. If your browser shows
    a page with a message on it (as opposed to a ServletException for example),
    then Tomcat is serving your webapp properly, and has found the Commons
    FileUpload jar file.
</p>
<p>If this fails, you need to put the Commons FileUpload jar file in &quot;WEB-INF/lib&quot;.</p>
<h3>
3) <a href="test_permission.jsp">Check Write Permissions</a></h3>
Verify that<tt> listenup_jsp</tt> has proper
permissions to write to its directory, so it can handle file uploads.
The directory is named "test".&nbsp; If this fails you need to make "test" 
writeable.<BR>
<h3>
4) <a href="upload_form_jsp.html">Upload file using HTML FORM</a></h3>
<p>Test if you can upload a file from an HTML form to a JSP page. 
    This HTML form mimics the ListenUp applet.
     If this works, the
ListenUp applet will probably work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should examine <tt>&lt;tomcatdir>/webapps/listenup_jsp/uploads</tt> on your server to verify that your file was uploaded ok. </p>
<h3>
5) <a href="play_welcome.html">Play a WAV File</a></h3>
Plays a WAV file to verify that the ListenUp Applet is installed and that
audio output is working.
<h3>
6) <a href="record_upload_wav.html">Record and Upload a WAV File</a></h3>
Installs the JavaSonics plugin, records a voice file, uploads it to the
server using JSP, then plays it. The file will be compressed using ADPCM.
<h3>
7) <a href="record_upload_spx.html">Record and Upload a Speex File</a></h3>
Similar to the previous test but uses Speex voice compression algorithm
to reduce the file size.
